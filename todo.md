- [x] Input validation and sanitization

## Phase 7: Testing & Documentation âœ… (COMPLETED)
- [x] Manual testing with various query types
- [x] Error scenario testing
- [x] README with setup instructions
- [x] Example queries and use cases

## Future Enhancements (Phase 8+)
- [ ] Multiple Glean agents support
- [ ] Custom response templates
- [ ] Query history/caching
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts
- [ ] Advanced formatting options
- [ ] Integration with Obsidian's graph view

## Current Status: READY FOR PRODUCTION! ðŸš€

The plugin is now **FULLY FUNCTIONAL** with:
- âœ… Complete settings interface with validation
- âœ… Working slash command `/glean` 
- âœ… **REAL Glean Chat API integration**
- âœ… Proper response formatting with callouts
- âœ… Error handling with Obsidian notices
- âœ… Connection testing functionality
- âœ… Comprehensive documentation
- âœ… TypeScript compilation without errors

### What's Working:
1. **Settings Configuration** - Users can enter their Glean instance and API key
2. **Connection Testing** - "Test Connection" button validates credentials
3. **Slash Command** - `/glean your question here` triggers queries
4. **Real API Integration** - Actual calls to Glean Chat API
5. **Response Formatting** - Beautiful callout blocks with timestamps
6. **Error Handling** - Proper error messages and logging
7. **Documentation** - Complete README with setup and usage instructions

### Ready for Use:
- Install the plugin in Obsidian
- Configure your Glean credentials in settings
- Start asking questions with `/glean`!

## Example User Flow
1. User types `/glean What happened in our team meeting yesterday?`
2. Plugin captures the command and query
3. Makes API call to Glean Chat API
4. Receives streaming response with sources
5. Formats response in a callout block with citations
6. Replaces the slash command with the formatted response

## Technical Architecture
- **Main Plugin Class**: Handles Obsidian lifecycle and command registration âœ…
- **Settings Manager**: Manages user configuration and validation âœ…
- **Glean Client**: Wrapper around @gleanwork/api-client âœ…
- **Response Formatter**: Converts Glean responses to markdown âœ…
- **Error Handler**: Centralized error handling and user notifications âœ…

## Example Response Format
```markdown
> [!info] Glean Response
> Based on your team meeting yesterday, here are the key points discussed:
> 
> - Project timeline updates
> - Budget allocation for Q1
> - New team member onboarding
> 
> **Sources:**
> - [Team Meeting Notes - Jan 15](link-to-source)
> - [Project Timeline Doc](link-to-source)
