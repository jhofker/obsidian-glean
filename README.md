## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

If you see "Connection failed" errors:

1. Verify your instance name is correct (just the domain part, not the full URL)
2. Check that your API key has the correct `CHAT` scope permissions
3. Ensure your network allows connections to your Glean instance
4. Try the "Test Connection" button in settings

### No Response or Empty Response

If queries return empty responses:

1. Check that your Glean instance has content indexed
2. Verify you have permission to access the relevant data sources
3. Try simpler, more general queries first
4. Check the browser console for detailed error messages

### Plugin Not Loading

1. Ensure you've enabled the plugin in Community Plugins settings
2. Check that all files are in the correct plugin directory
3. Restart Obsidian after installation
4. Check the console for any error messages
